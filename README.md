Detects malicious activity :
🧩 Process monitoring - File system activity - Network traffic inspection (L3–L7)
✅ Policy-as-Code ( You can define and enforce behavioral security policies as Kubernetes CRDs )
✅ Zero-Trust Network Security ( Microsegmentation of container-to-container communications )
✅ Admission Control ( Validates image scanning or labels before workload deployment )
✅ UI and CLI Support ( You can manage policies and view events via a web UI )
