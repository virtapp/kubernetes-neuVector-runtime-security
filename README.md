## NeuVector | Kubernetes ☸️
NeuVector Full Lifecycle Container Security Platform delivers the only cloud-native security with uncompromising end-to-end protection from DevOps vulnerability protection to automated run-time security, and featuring a true Layer 7 container firewall.

🧱 Core Components
```
✅ Runtime Threat Detection
Detects malicious activity (reverse shells, crypto miners, port scans, etc.) using:
## Process monitoring
## File system activity
## Network traffic inspection (L3–L7)
✅ Policy-as-Code ( You can define and enforce behavioral security policies as Kubernetes CRDs )
✅ Zero-Trust Network Security ( Microsegmentation of container-to-container communications )
✅ Admission Control ( Validates image scanning or labels before workload deployment )
✅ UI and CLI Support ( You can manage policies and view events via a web UI or through Kubernetes-native CRDs )
